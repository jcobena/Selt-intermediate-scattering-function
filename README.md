Python code to compute the self-intermediate scattering function from trajectory files created with LAMMPS.
This code can be used as a post-processing tool. 
The code calculates the self-intermediate scattering function in the z dimension, but it can easily be extender to more dimensions.
Check the "example_test" in the Cage correlation function code to see the format of the input files.
