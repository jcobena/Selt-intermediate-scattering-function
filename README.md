Python code to compute the self-intermediate scattering function from trajectory files created with LAMMPS.
This code can be used as a post-processing tool. 
The code only calculated the self-intermediate scattering function in one dimension, but it can easily be extender to more dimensions.
Check the "example_input" to see the format of the files.
